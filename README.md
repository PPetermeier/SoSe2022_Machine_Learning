# SoSe2022_Machine_Learning
Welcome! This is the personal learning repository of me, Philipp from Germany, learning about Machine Learning in a Masters-Course at the THM (www.thm.de) in Friedberg, Hesse.
Here, i hope to document my learning experience with my scored assignements for my teacher, current and future me and, apparently strangers on the internet just stumbling into here. 
After a lot of rather clumsy usage of Git in past i sincerly hope to do better this time, commit only as much as needed for the sake of brevity and order, document as precise, concise and clear as possible, just as much as needed. 
At the moment of writing, even before the first assignment came due, i plan to document everything in the end here: Assignments, Code with Version Control and finally my Overviews for the assignments in LaTeX, just in case i or someone else might learn something from an of these.
Those LaTeX-Files will of course also contain BibTeX with Citations for those interested.
